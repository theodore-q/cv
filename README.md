Full Stack Javascript web developer with project management and leadership experience.
Excited by new challenges and driven by the prospect of building products that fundamentally change the ways that we interact with each other and our favourite brands.

I have experience troubleshooting issues with marketing agencies for household name brands including Spotify, Mcdonalds and Nestle. I have designed, architectured and built frontend and backend components for a Social remarketing tool with cross site user tracking, AB testing and reporting for a highly valued startup.
